Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p> <p>If a member engages in harassing behaviour, activity organizers or board members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the activity. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding violations of this policy, please contact a member of activity staff or a board member immediately. For each activity, it will be announced how to identify the staff.</p> <p>Actitivity staff and board members are happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or in any other way assist those experiencing harassment. Having a safe environment for our members and activity participants is of paramount importance to us, and we value your help towards creating this space.</p> <p>Beyond creating a safe environment, we want to encourage open citizenship. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p> <p>Associate and full members, volunteers, and activity participants are subject to this policy at all association activities and associate-related social events. We invite all our members and those who participate in our activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section> <div class=container> <div class=text-center> <h2 class=section-heading>Our Contact Information</h2> <p>If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch with board members or activities staff.
