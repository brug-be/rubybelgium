      %p We live in the Internet age, where we have so many digital channels to communicate.
      %p Getting to know people "in real life", though, can still be very rewarding.
      %p That's why, every third Tuesday of the month, the Ruby community is gathering in a co-working space.
      %p The objectives are diverse: meet everybody, have a chat about common interests, listen to tech talks, or getting help with projects.
      %p There are always beginners and seasoned developers attending, so don't be afraid to join the party, and ask for advices.
