            Ruby Belgium is a **community** of programming enthusiasts using ruby as a tool to  **connect**, build and share knowledge.

            We promote the use of the ruby language, support the ruby job market, organize events to **help beginners through their learning journey** and **gather people around our core values: sharing, fun, mutual respect**.

            We believe ruby has a big role to play in the Belgian tech ecosystem. Ruby is also a good starting point for **anyone who wants to learn to program**.
