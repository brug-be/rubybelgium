      Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is now a global, non-profit volunteer community.
      Our goal is to give girls and women enough tools to understand technology and a supportive community to help them build their ideas.
      We do this by organizing a 1 evening + 1 day ruby bootcamp with online training materials and coaches to help them along the way.
